Each dataset will have at least 2 classes, including 1 'negative' class which consists of
data that does not match any pattern.

Dataset 1: Process connects to a socket, then writes to a file.
Field count = 1
Field size = 3
Stride = 3
HASH_PROPERTIES = ['cmdline', 'name', 'ips', 'client_port', 'meta_login']
HASH_FN = hash_labels_prop
RECEPTIVE_FIELD_HASH = hash_simhash
LABELING_FN = get_ts
CLASS_COUNT = 2
DEFAULT_TENSOR_VAL = 0
CLEAN_TRAIN_DATA = False
x_train1.shape = (378, 3, 5, 1)
y_train1.shape = (378, 2)

Dataset 2: Process connects to a socket, then writes to a file. Process connects to a socket,
then executes a file
Field count = 1
Field size = 3
Stride = 3
HASH_PROPERTIES = ['cmdline', 'name', 'ips', 'client_port', 'meta_login']
HASH_FN = hash_labels_prop
RECEPTIVE_FIELD_HASH = hash_simhash
LABELING_FN = get_ts
CLASS_COUNT = 3
DEFAULT_TENSOR_VAL = 0
CLEAN_TRAIN_DATA = False
x_train2.shape = (6000, 3, 5, 1)
y_train2.shape = (6000, 3)

Dataset 3: Process connects to a socket, then writes to a file, then executes a file.
Field count = 1
Field size = 4
Stride = 4

DEFAULT_TENSOR_VAL = 0
CLEAN_TRAIN_DATA = False
x_train3.shape = (2000, 4, 5, 1)
y_train3.shape = (2000, 2)

Dataset 4: Process connects to a socket, writes to a file starting with '/usr' and
reads the file named '/etc/libmap.conf'. The negative data for this dataset is exactly
the same as the pattern described above, except the file read by the process is not named
'/etc/libmap.conf'.
