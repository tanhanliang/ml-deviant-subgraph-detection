Each dataset will have at least 2 classes, including 1 'negative' class which consists of
data that does not match any pattern.

Dataset 1: Process connects to a socket, then writes to a file.
Field count = 1
Field size = 3
Stride = 3
HASH_PROPERTIES = ['cmdline', 'name', 'ips', 'client_port', 'meta_login']
HASH_FN = hash_labels_prop
RECEPTIVE_FIELD_HASH = hash_simhash
LABELING_FN = get_ts
CLASS_COUNT = 2
DEFAULT_TENSOR_VAL = 0
CLEAN_TRAIN_DATA = False
x.shape = (378, 3, 5, 1)
y.shape = (378, 2)

Dataset 2: Process connects to a socket, then writes to a file. Process connects to a socket,
then executes a file
